# Automatic Question Generation with Pre-trained Masked Language Models


Repository for the experimental code of my master degree thesis

- [Thesis link](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1524925&dswid=-35)

This repo includes:
1. The replication of [A Recurrent BERT-based Model for Question Generation"](https://aclanthology.org/D19-5821/)
2. u-PMLM for question generation

For any question please contact Chris C.H. Lin via the email in the commit message.

## Acknowledgments
1. Ying-Hong Chan and YaoChung Fan gave me their experimental code in 2020. I rewrote it for better understanding and more clear structure in terms of Software Engineering standard.
