# Automatic Question Generation with Pre-trained Masked Language Models


Repository for the experimental code of my master degree thesis

- [Master degree thesis](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1524925&dswid=-35)

This repo includes:
1. The replication of [A Recurrent BERT-based Model for Question Generation"](https://aclanthology.org/D19-5821/)
2. [u-PMLM](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.24.pdf) for question generation
3. The largest trained model, which should be okay to replicate the paper result

For any question please check the thesis and contact Chris C.H. Lin via the email in the commit message.


## Acknowledgments
1. Ying-Hong Chan and YaoChung Fan gave me their experimental code in 2020. Thanks for their help.
   I rewrote it for better understanding and cleaner structure in terms of Software Engineering.
