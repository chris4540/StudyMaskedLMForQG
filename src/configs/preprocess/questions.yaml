# Configuration file for pre-processing: sentence splitting.

# Quote:
# With the offset of the answer to each question, we locate the sentence
# containing the answer and use it as the input sentence. In some cases
# (< 0.17% in training set), the answer spans two or more sentences, and we
# then use the concatenation of the sentences as the input “sentence”.
