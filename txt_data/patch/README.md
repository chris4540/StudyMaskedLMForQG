Patching questions
------------------


Author: Chris Chun Hung Lin  
Date: 8th Auguest, 2020  


This folder contains manually fixed questions for SQuAD v1.1.  

The purpose is to have better generations results as SQuAD is originally for question generation.  
Some questions are answerable but not grammatically correct questions.  

While this work is not perfect yet I hope people could make use of it.
